# RAG based Quiz Bot for Network Security Course

## Project Overview
This project involves building a **Quiz Bot** based on a **Network Security** course using open-source alternatives to ChatGPT that can be run entirely on your **local machine**. The main focus is to ensure data privacy by avoiding any internet-based interactionsâ€”keeping all processes and data confined to your local system.

## Key Features
- **Data Privacy**: Since sending data over the internet can compromise privacy, this bot is designed to run locally on your machine.
- **Question Types**:
  - **Randomly Generated Questions**: The bot will provide randomly selected questions from the Network Security database.
  - **Specific Topic Questions**: Users can request questions based on specific topics within the Network Security course.
- **Answer Sources**: Answers to the quiz questions will be pulled from a custom database that you will train using various materials, such as:
  - Network security quizzes
  - Lecture slides
  - Network security textbooks
  - Relevant Internet resources (can be used offline for training purposes)

## Question Formats
The quiz bot will support the following types of questions:
- **Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs)**
- **True/False Questions**
- **Open-Ended Questions**

## Feedback Mechanism
- The bot will not only quiz the user but also provide **feedback** on their answers. This allows users to learn from their mistakes and improve their knowledge of Network Security concepts.
