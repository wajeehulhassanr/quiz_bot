## Network Security: Private Communication in a Non-Private World

**Chapter 1: Introduction**

*   The book discusses how to communicate securely over an insecure medium.
*   The authors' opinions do not necessarily reflect the views of any of their employers. The mention of commercial products is for informational purposes only.
*   The book offers insights into designs beyond basic specifications.

**Chapter 2: Introduction to Cryptography**

*   **Cryptography is used to achieve security features like:**
    *   Confidentiality (keeping communication private).
    *   Integrity checking (ensuring messages haven't been altered).
    *   Authentication (verifying identity).
*   **Types of cryptographic functions:**
    *   Hash functions
    *   Secret key functions
    *   Public key functions
*   **Secret key cryptography** uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
*   **Public key cryptography** uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It can also be used for digital signatures.
*   **Hash functions** take an input of any length and produce a fixed-length output. They are computationally infeasible to reverse.
*   **Attacks on cryptographic systems:**
    *   Ciphertext-only attack
    *   Known-plaintext attack
    *   Chosen-plaintext attack

**Chapter 3: Secret Key Cryptography**

*   **Block ciphers** encrypt fixed-length blocks of plaintext.
*   **Keysize and block size must be large enough to prevent brute-force attacks.**
*   **Practical block ciphers often use multiple rounds of a simpler, less secure cipher.**
*   **DES (Data Encryption Standard) is an example of a block cipher.**

**Chapter 4: Modes of Operation**

*   **Modes of operation define how to encrypt messages larger than a single block.**
*   **Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode is the simplest but least secure mode.**
*   **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode adds security by chaining blocks together.**
*   **Counter (CTR) mode encrypts a counter value and XORs it with the plaintext.**
*   **XTS mode is designed for encrypting data stored on a disk.**
*   **Ciphertext stealing is a technique for achieving length preservation in block cipher modes.**
*   **Message Authentication Codes (MACs) provide cryptographic integrity checks.**
*   **CBC-MAC uses the last block of CBC encryption as the MAC.**
*   **CMAC is a variant of CBC-MAC that addresses some security weaknesses.**
*   **Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) provides both encryption and authentication.**

**Chapter 5: Cryptographic Hashes**

*   **Hash functions are used for various purposes, including:**
    *   Password hashing
    *   Message fingerprinting
    *   Efficient digital signatures
    *   Secure shorthand of data
*   **Collision resistance is a key property of hash functions.**
*   **Hash trees (Merkle trees) provide efficient hashing of large data structures.**
*   **The append attack exploits a vulnerability in some hash function constructions.**
*   **SHA-3 and SHAKE are examples of secure hash functions.**

**Chapter 6: First-Generation Public Key Algorithms**

*   **RSA** is a widely used public key algorithm for encryption and digital signatures.
*   **ElGamal, DSA, and ECDSA** are public key algorithms primarily used for digital signatures.
*   **Diffie-Hellman and ECDH** are key exchange algorithms that can also be used for encryption.
*   **PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standard) defines encodings for RSA keys, signatures, and encrypted messages.**

**Chapter 7: Quantum Computing**

*   A sufficiently large quantum computer could break the security of many public key algorithms, including RSA and those based on the discrete logarithm problem.

**Chapter 8: Post-Quantum Cryptography**

*   This chapter focuses on cryptographic algorithms that are believed to be resistant to attacks by quantum computers.
*   **Hash-based signatures** rely on the security of hash functions.
*   **Lattice-based cryptography** is based on the difficulty of finding short vectors in lattices.
*   **Code-based cryptography** utilizes error-correcting codes.
*   **Multivariate cryptography** involves systems of polynomial equations.

**Chapter 9: Authentication of People**

*   This chapter discusses various methods for authenticating users.
*   **Password-based authentication** is the most common method, but it has vulnerabilities.
*   **Strong password protocols** aim to protect passwords even if the server's database is compromised.
*   **Lamport's hash** is a one-time password scheme.

**Chapter 10: Trusted Intermediaries**

*   **Kerberos** is a trusted third-party authentication system.
*   **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** uses certificates to establish trust relationships.

**Chapter 11: Communication Session Establishment**

*   This chapter covers protocols for establishing secure communication sessions.
*   **One-way and mutual authentication** can be achieved using shared secrets or public keys.
*   **Session keys** are used to protect data during a session.
*   **Perfect forward secrecy (PFS)** ensures that past communication remains secure even if long-term secrets are compromised.

**Chapter 12: IPsec**

*   **IPsec** is a suite of protocols for securing IP communications.
*   **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)** is used to establish security associations and negotiate keys.
*   **AH (Authentication Header)** provides integrity protection.
*   **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)** provides encryption and optionally integrity protection.

**Chapter 13: SSL/TLS and SSH**

*   **SSL/TLS** is a protocol for securing web traffic.
*   **SSH** is a protocol for secure remote login and file transfer.

**Chapter 14: Electronic Mail Security**

*   **Email security** involves protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of email messages.
*   **Digital signatures** and encryption can be used to secure email.

**Chapter 15: Bitcoin**

*   **Bitcoin** is a cryptocurrency that uses a blockchain to record transactions.
*   **Mining** is the process of verifying and adding transactions to the blockchain.

**Chapter 16: Cryptographic Tricks**

*   This chapter covers various cryptographic techniques, including secret sharing, zero-knowledge proofs, and oblivious transfer.

**Chapter 17: Folklore**

*   This chapter discusses common cryptographic practices and misconceptions.
*   **Key rollover** is important for limiting the impact of compromised keys.
*   **Encryption should always be combined with integrity protection.**
